          1. Participants Must Go through the pdf and resources carefully, which
          will be provided and should follow them in order to start and comple
          this Upskilling Program with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Participants should be careful of the timescale and deadlines of
          each task. i.e., they should always be prepared with their task before
          the deadline and submit them in the link provided on the website .
        </p>
        <p>
          3. There is a grading system for the submission of task :- i) If
          Submitted before the deadline , grading will be done from 100. ii) If
          Submitted one day after , grading will be done from 70. iii) If
          Submitted 2 days after , grading will be done from 40. After that ,
          the link will be closed for that particular task.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. If a participant fails to submit his work on time or his submission
          gets disqualified by the mentors , then he must focus on following
          week's tasks . We will provide Certificates and perks after
          calculating the whole 4 weeks' result. You will be getting enough time
          to improve, show , try to be consistent throughout the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. And the most important thing , participants will get only one
          chance to submit there task in the link provided on the website. So ,
          make sure you submit the correct task.
